## Clue 

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
Commands you may need to solve this level

Fuck yea! 


First, use cat to read the new key. Copy and paste that key locally. 

Leave the session.

Change permissions on the new key with: 

`chmod 600 KEYNAME` 

then login via ssh: 

`ssh -i NEWFILE bandit14@...`
