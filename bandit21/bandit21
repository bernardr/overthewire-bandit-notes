Weird one. 

First navigated to /etc/cron.d/ 

and found the `cronjob_bandit22` file. 

Read the file w/ `cat` got the following: 

@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

Tried rulling the shell file and got an error about not being able to create a directory ... this was probably due to the fact that the script isn't able to run  yet. 

This point to a file here: /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv


cat that file and you get ...
